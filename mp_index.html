            <p><strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
                Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
                authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.</p>
            
            <p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
                    learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
                    technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
                    Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
                    worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
                    fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
                    graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>
            
            <p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside 
                    your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.

                    four wheels - from the East and the West!</p>
